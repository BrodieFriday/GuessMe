# GuessMe

**Version 1.0.0**

I started this project to enhance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This is project is 
designed for younger kids as the goal is to guess the correct animal based on a detailed picture
of its fur and a short hint if necessary. Since this is designed for a younger audience, I included
a way to skip animals if the user gets stuck. If the user guesses correctly then they are presented
with a short information section about the animal along with revealing the animal by displaying a full size photo.
